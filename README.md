# Rdio

Talk radio for everyone.

### Getting Started

- `bundle install`
- `yarn install`
- `bin/rails db:create`
- `bin/rails db:migrate`
- `bin/rails db:seed` (also creates a user, `user@example.com` with password `password`)
- `bin/rails s`

(Optional: run `./bin/webpack-dev-server` to speed up JavaScript recompilation)
